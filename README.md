Hello users, my name is @Koustav De
As part of my practical learning in web development, I built a fully functional ToDo application using Flask and SQLAlchemy
I started by designing a clean and minimalistic web interface using HTML templates integrated with Jinja2, allowing dynamic rendering of tasks. Flask served as the core framework to manage routing and server-side logic. I implemented routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
